    question: How long does it take to install a home automation system?
    answer: It will depend on the type and depth of the system you would like to
      install, ie. the Brilliant home automation controller can be installed and
      programmed within hours. Each additional device (ie. lighting, security
      camera, music system, window shades, garage door and climate control) can
      also be installed and programmed within hours. In short, anywhere from one
      day to less than a week for the average Brilliant home automation system,
      depending on the number of automation device you decide to include in the
      system.
    faqs:
      - question: Do I need a separate app installed on my mobile or tablet device to
          control the multiple devices in the system?
        answer: No you do not. All of the separate device apps are bundled together
          within the Brilliant app and can be accessed from anywhere you have a
          data and/or wi-fi connection.
      - question: Do I need special wiring to install a home automation system?
        answer: Some systems require dedicated wiring and some do not. The Brilliant
          system works off of your home wi-fi. You simply replace your regular
          light switch with a Brilliant Controller and/or a Brilliant Dimmer and
          you have now installed the foundation for a whole house automation
          system.
      - question: What kind of lighting do you recommend for the different areas within
          a family home or condo?
        answer: >-
          Residential lighting types can broken down into three major
          categories: general lighting, task lighting, and special event
          lighting. Within those categories are three main lighting
          requirements: daytime lighting, evening/nighttime lighting and
          specialty lighting, such as specific or multi-colour lighting.
          <br><br> 

          Daylight lighting will have a more balanced red green and blue colour spectrum. This is important to compliment our natural circadian rhythm work day cycle. Evening and nighttime lighting has less blue light, which is very important for preparing us for our sleep cycle. Ideally, the lighting in your home should change from daytime to nighttime colour spectrum automatically. An automated lighting system can be programmed to do this for you.
