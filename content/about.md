       “It is very satisfying to provide a client with an automated and/or home entertainment system that compliments their personal technology needs and tastes. Our custom designed systems not only enhance one’s lifestyle, but are also artistically sensitive. That is what excites the creative side of me.”<br>
      - Richard Stokes, Principal.<br><br>


      Richard brings many decades of electrical and audio video systems experience plus a passion for home automation to Finely Tuned Technologies. Originally from Ireland, Richard began his working career as a journeyman electrician in Dublin, Ireland. Upon completion of his electrical apprenticeship Richard moved into the world of audio video systems design and installation. When he moved to Vancouver, Canada at the age of 36, he put his extensive experience in audio video systems design to work as the manager of the Engineered Systems Division of A&B Sound, BC and Alberta.<br><br>

      Over the ten years managing the Engineered Systems Division, Richard’s team specialized in the design and installation of custom audio video and home theatre systems for the residential and luxury yacht industries. <br><br>

      Richard is an instructor and certified calibrator with the Imaging Science Foundation and a certified home theatre design and installation technician for Lucas film THX residential systems.

      In 2007, Richard launched Finely Tuned Technologies.<br><br>

      <br>

      <br>

      Technology continues to change and grow becoming an integral part of our day- to-day lives. It is our experience to date, that most automated systems to date have been unreliable, require regular maintenance, and are unnecessarily complex.<br><br>

      The simplicity and efficiency of the Brilliant technology provides any age group with the ability to use and easily navigate a fully automated smart home.  No more complex than any existing app on their mobile device.<br><br>


      Whether you have a large or small residential project, a multi-family community project, or a condominium tower, our technology and expertise will be of great benefit to both your design team and your clients.<br><br>


      As proven experts in the collective fields of home automation, audio video systems, and home theatre systems, we prioritize customer service and are always ready to answer your questions.
