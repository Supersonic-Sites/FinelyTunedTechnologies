      <p class="text-base italic"> “It is very satisfying to provide a client
      with an automated and/or home entertainment system that compliments their
      personal technology needs and tastes. Our custom designed systems not only
      enhance one’s lifestyle, but are also artistically sensitive. That is what
      excites the creative side of me.”<br>

      <span class="ml-2">- Richard Stokes, Principal.</p><br></p>

      <div class="text-xl text-gray-700 mb-6">

      Richard began his career as a journeyman electrician in Dublin, Ireland. Upon completion of his electrical apprenticeship, Richard then progressed into the world of audio-video systems design and installation. He moved to Vancouver, Canada, in 1991. His extensive experience in audio video systems design and installation provided a solid foundation for the management of the Engineered Systems Division of A&B Sound, throughout western Canada.<br><br>

      During the ten years as manager of the Engineered Systems Division, Richard’s team specialized in the design and installation of custom audio-video and home theatre systems for the residential and luxury yacht industries.<br><br>

      In 2007, Richard launched Finely Tuned Technologies.<br><br>

      As an instructor and certified calibrator with the Imaging Science Foundation (ISF), and a certified home theatre design and installation technician for THX residential systems, the company initially focused on providing a home theatre system calibration service to local retail outlets, the local film industry, video and gaming content creators, and residential clients.<br><br>

      With the current growth in home automation, Finely Tuned Technologies have recently partnered with leading edge companies in this category.<br><br>

      From multi residential units, community housing, and condominium towers, Richard and his team offer client-centered top-tier automation services that will benefit both the project design team and the end user alike.<br><br>

      With diligent smart system design and proven smart product selection, it is now a reality for every home to have the young and the not so young automate their daily routine tasks.

      As proven experts in the collective fields of home automation, audio video systems, and home theatre systems, we prioritize customer service and are available to answer your questions.<br><br>
