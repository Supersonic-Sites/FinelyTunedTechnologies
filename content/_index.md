        desc: Finely Tuned Technologies (FTT) was referred to me many, many years ago. I
          needed to calibrate my Media Room projector and my surround sound
          system. It quickly became evident that Richard was an expert in his
          field, a stickler for detail and exactness which is truly hard to find
          these days. Richard has always responded to my electronics needs in
          the most professional and expeditious way. I recently had FTT install
          a 'Smart Home' system throughout my house that controls security
          cameras, music, lights, heating and leak detection. Richard installed
          all the Smart Home equipment to his usual exacting standard and I am
          very pleased with the result. I highly recommend the services of
          Finely Tuned Technologies.

          I recently had a voice activated home automation system installed by
          Richard Stokes @ Finely Tuned Technologies. As with his A/V and home
          theatre skills (which I have used for 15 yrs) Richard displays
          thorough knowledge and ability with his subject. His services are
          timely, efficient and unparalleled , and he is readily available for
          any queries before and after services = impeccable.  I would have no
          hesitation in recommending him for your needs.

          I recently had Richard Stokes (Finely Tuned Technologies) adjust and
          upgrade my home theatre. It was a pleasure to watch him work –
          relentless at getting everything as perfect as possible. I had the
          system upgraded to high definition and WOW what a difference. It feels
          like you could walk into the picture, as it is so real now. Thank you,
          Richard, for all your care and expertise and providing a
          movie-watching experience that is second to none.
