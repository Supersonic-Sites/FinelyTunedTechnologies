    question: How long does it take to install a home automation system?
    answer: It will depend on the type and depth of the system you would like to
      install, ie. the Brilliant home automation controller can be installed and
      programmed within hours. Each additional device (ie. lighting, security
      camera, music system, window shades, garage door and climate control) can
      also be installed and programmed within hours. In short, anywhere from one
      day to less than a week for the average Brilliant home automation system,
      depending on the number of automation device you decide to include in the
      system.
    faqs:
      - question: Do I need a separate app installed on my mobile or tablet device to
          control the multiple devices in the system?
        answer: No you do not. All of the separate device apps are bundled together
          within the Brilliant app and can be accessed from anywhere you have a
          data and/or wi-fi connection.
      - question: Do I need special wiring to install a home automation system?
        answer: Some systems require dedicated wiring and some do not. The Brilliant
          system works off of your home wi-fi. You simply replace your regular
          light switch with a Brilliant Controller and/or a Brilliant Dimmer and
          you have now installed the foundation for a whole house automation
          system.
      - question: What kind of lighting do you recommend for the different areas within
          a family home or condo?
        answer: >-
          Residential lighting types can broken down into three major
          categories: general lighting, task lighting, and special event
          lighting. Within those categories are three main lighting
          requirements: daytime lighting, evening/nighttime lighting and
          specialty lighting, such as specific or multi-colour lighting.
          <br><br> 

          Daylight lighting will have a more balanced red green and blue colour spectrum. This is important to compliment our natural circadian rhythm work day cycle. Evening and nighttime lighting has less blue light, which is very important for preparing us for our sleep cycle. Ideally, the lighting in your home should change from daytime to nighttime colour spectrum automatically. An automated lighting system can be programmed to do this for you.

        desc: Finely Tuned Technologies (FTT) was referred to me many, many years ago. I
          needed to calibrate my Media Room projector and my surround sound
          system. It quickly became evident that Richard was an expert in his
          field, a stickler for detail and exactness which is truly hard to find
          these days. Richard has always responded to my electronics needs in
          the most professional and expeditious way. I recently had FTT install
          a 'Smart Home' system throughout my house that controls security
          cameras, music, lights, heating and leak detection. Richard installed
          all the Smart Home equipment to his usual exacting standard and I am
          very pleased with the result. I highly recommend the services of
          Finely Tuned Technologies.

          I recently had a voice activated home automation system installed by
          Richard Stokes @ Finely Tuned Technologies. As with his A/V and home
          theatre skills (which I have used for 15 yrs) Richard displays
          thorough knowledge and ability with his subject. His services are
          timely, efficient and unparalleled , and he is readily available for
          any queries before and after services = impeccable.  I would have no
          hesitation in recommending him for your needs.

          I recently had Richard Stokes (Finely Tuned Technologies) adjust and
          upgrade my home theatre. It was a pleasure to watch him work –
          relentless at getting everything as perfect as possible. I had the
          system upgraded to high definition and WOW what a difference. It feels
          like you could walk into the picture, as it is so real now. Thank you,
          Richard, for all your care and expertise and providing a
          movie-watching experience that is second to none.
