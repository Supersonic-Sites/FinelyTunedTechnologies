        desc: I just wanted to take a minute and thank you for doing an outstanding job
          calibrating both my projector and my 55". Using your services was
          worth its weight in gold and everyone that sees my picture quality it
          truly blown away.

        desc: Over the years, Richard has done numerous installations and calibrations
          of my home theater. He has shown incredible knowledge and aptitude in
          his work. His attention to every detail of this technology is amazing.
          I would not hesitate for a moment in recommending him for any job
          requiring audio/video installation.

        desc: By George I think you’ve got it! There is enough going on here to keep me
          amused for a few lifetimes. Thanks for your patience and
          persistence.  It exceeds my ideas of what a sound system could be.
          Thank you.

        desc: Richard Stokes and Finely Tuned Technologies showed me the difference
          between TV and entertainment. Once Richard was finished getting my
          home theatre finely tuned, I realize now much I had been missing with
          both the picture and the accompanying audio. Movie night at our house
          is now an event!

        desc: Richard has both the creative eye and the technical expertise to get the
          best picture possible from my display. The difference is night and
          day.

        desc: I like my movies and as the new technologies come to market, I rely on
          Richard to integrate each one into my home theatre. His passion for
          detail gets it right every time.

        desc: The video is definitely a lot better, but the sound….wow. The evening
          after you did the calibration, we sat down and watched a music
          DVD….Elton John's 60th Birthday at Madison Square Garden. My wife
          said, "I can't believe how great the sound is!" It was just like being
          at the concert, but with better views.
