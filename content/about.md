      <br><br>

      Technology has become an integral part of life and it continues to change and grow. We loved the potential in smart technology but found most systems to date unreliable, high maintenance, and unnecessarily complex. 

      <br><br>

      We found the perfect solution in the Brilliant® Smart Home System, a technology  designed for today and into the future. Brilliant® unites all current top tier smart technology Apps systems into one Brilliant app, making it not only user friendly, efficient, and convenient, but very affordable and reliable.

      <br><br>

      At Finely Tuned Technologies, we’re proud to be certified design and installation 

      partners with Brilliant, ButterflyMX, the Imaging Science Foundation, and THX Home 

      Theatre Systems. 

      <br><br>

      Whether you have a large or small residential project, a multi-family community project, 

      or a condominium tower our technology and expertise has you covered. As proven 

      experts in the collective fields of home automation, audio video systems, home theatre 

      systems, we prioritize customer service and are ready to answer your questions.

      <br><p class="text-black text-xl tracking-wider">

      “It is very satisfying to provide a client with an automated and or audio video system

      that compliments their personal technology needs and tastes. These custom designed 

      systems not only maximize one’s lifestyle, but they are also artistically sensitive. That 

      excites the artist in me.”<br>

      - Richard Stokes, Founder

      <br><br>

      Richard brings many decades of electrical, audio video systems experience and a passion for home automation to Finely Tuned Technologies. Originally from Ireland, Richard began his electrical career with a 5 year apprenticeship with the Electricity Generation and Supply Board in Dublin. When he moved to Vancouver, Canada at the age of 36, he put his extensive history in audio video systems engineering to work as the manager of the Engineered Systems Division of A&B Sound, BC and Alberta.

      <br><br> 

      Over the ten years at Engineered Systems Division, Richard’s team specialized in  custom audio video and home theatre systems design and installation in both the residential and luxury yacht industries. He also became both an instructor and certified calibrator with the Imaging Science Foundation and a certified home theatre design and installation technician for LucasfilmTHX residential systems <br><br>

      In 2007, Richard launched Finely Tuned Technologies. 

      <br><br> 

      The company's initial focus was on providing a home theatre systems calibration service to local retail outlets, film, video and gaming content creators, and residential clients. The company's tag line ‘recreating the artist's intent’ was a shout out to Richard’s creative passion to honour the content creator in reproducing their art as close as possible to the original. 

      <br><br> 

      Fast forward to 2021 Richard believes Smart Home Technology has come of age. The  technology has reached a point where it is now very user friendly for all ages, very reliable, and very affordable. He is confident that diligent smart system design and proven smart product selection will allow the automation of daily routine tasks for both the young and the not so young to become a reality in their homes. 

      <br><br> 

      Richard is proud to offer top-quality services that now extend from residential to 

      commercial, and also cover large scale products. <br><br>
