    question: How long does it take to install a home automation system?
    answer: It will depend on the type and depth of the system you would like to
      install. For example, the Brilliant home automation controller can be
      installed and programmed in just a few hours. Each additional device,
      lighting, security camera, music system, window shades, garage door and
      climate control, can also be installed and programmed within hours. In
      short, anywhere from one day to less than a week for the average Brilliant
      home automation system, depending on the number of automation devices you
      decide to include in the system.
    faqs:
      - question: Do I need a separate app installed on my mobile or tablet device to
          control the multiple devices in the system?
        answer: No, you do not. All of the separate device apps are bundled together
          within the Brilliant app and can be accessed from anywhere you have a
          data or a Wi-Fi connection.
      - question: Do I need special wiring to install a home automation system?
        answer: Some systems require dedicated wiring. The Brilliant system does not as
          it works with your home Wi-Fi. You simply replace your regular light
          switch with a Brilliant Controller and you have now installed the
          foundation for a whole house automation system.
      - question: What kind of lighting do you recommend for the different areas within
          a family home or condo?
        answer: >-
          Residential lighting options can be broken down into three major
          categories: general lighting, task lighting, and special event
          lighting. Within these categories, there are three main lighting
          requirements. Daytime lighting, evening or nighttime lighting and
          specialty lighting, such as task specific or multi-coloured lighting.
          Natural daylight lighting will have a more balanced red, green and
          blue colour spectrum.<br><br>

          This is important to compliment our 24-hour circadian rhythm cycle.<br><br>

          Natural evening and nighttime lighting has less blue light, which is critical for a healthy sleep cycle. Similarly, just like natural sunrise and sunset lighting, the lighting in your home should change from daytime to nighttime colour spectrum automatically.<br><br>

          An automated lighting system designed by Finely Tuned Technologies can be programmed to do this for you.
